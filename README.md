# Classical Ciphers - 13 Encryption Algorithms

This repository provides implementations for **13 classical cipher algorithms**, commonly used for educational purposes and cryptography practice. It includes both **encryption** and **decryption** functions for each algorithm, enabling users to explore and experiment with traditional cryptographic techniques interactively.

## Ciphers Included:

1. **Caesar Cipher**  
   The Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most well-known encryption techniques. It works by shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.  
   **Example**: With a shift of 3, A becomes D, B becomes E, and so on.

2. **Atbash Cipher**  
   The Atbash cipher is a simple substitution cipher where the alphabet is reversed. This means A becomes Z, B becomes Y, and so on.  
   **Example**: Plaintext "ABC" would be encrypted as "ZYX".

3. **August Cipher**  
   The August cipher is a polyalphabetic cipher where the alphabet is shifted by a series of fixed values. It uses a simple pattern to apply these shifts, and the key provides the pattern.  
   **Example**: A key of 3 would shift the first letter by 3, the second by 2, and so on.

4. **Affine Cipher**  
   The Affine cipher is a substitution cipher that uses mathematical functions to encrypt text. The encryption formula is `E(x) = (ax + b) mod m`, where `a` and `b` are key values and `m` is the length of the alphabet.  
   **Example**: For key `a = 5` and `b = 8`, the encryption formula would be applied to each character in the plaintext.

5. **Vigenère Cipher**  
   The Vigenère cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher that uses a keyword. Each letter of the plaintext is shifted based on the corresponding letter of the keyword.  
   **Example**: If the keyword is "KEY", the first letter of the plaintext is shifted by the position of 'K', the second by the position of 'E', and so on.

6. **Gronsfeld Cipher**  
   The Gronsfeld cipher is a variation of the Vigenère cipher that uses numeric keys. It shifts each letter in the plaintext by the corresponding digit in the key.  
   **Example**: With the key "31415", the first letter is shifted by 3, the second by 1, and so on.

7. **Beaufort Cipher**  
   The Beaufort cipher is similar to the Vigenère cipher, but the encryption process is reversed. Instead of adding the key to the letter, you subtract the letter’s index from a fixed number (usually 26).  
   **Example**: For encryption, if the letter is "A" and the key is "K", the resulting letter is "U".

8. **Autokey Cipher**  
   The Autokey cipher is a polyalphabetic cipher where the key is extended by using the plaintext itself. This provides variable shifts for each letter in the plaintext.  
   **Example**: The first letter of the key is used for the first letter of the plaintext, and then the key continues with the plaintext itself.

9. **N-Gram Cipher**  
   The N-Gram cipher uses statistical analysis of letter sequences (n-grams) to decipher encrypted text. It’s based on the frequency of specific letter combinations in the language.  
   **Example**: Common 2-letter combinations like "TH" in English would help in deciphering the message.

10. **Hill Cipher**  
   The Hill cipher is a polygraphic substitution cipher that uses matrix multiplication to encrypt text. Text is grouped into blocks, and encryption is performed by multiplying the block of plaintext by a key matrix.  
   **Example**: Given a matrix for the key, the text is split into groups of letters and encrypted using matrix multiplication.

11. **Rail Fence Cipher**  
   The Rail Fence cipher is a transposition cipher where the text is written in a zigzag pattern over multiple rails (rows) and then read off row by row.  
   **Example**: If you write the plaintext over 3 rails and then read off each row, you get the encrypted message.

12. **Route Cipher**  
   The Route cipher is another transposition cipher where the plaintext is arranged in a grid, and the letters are then read in a predetermined pattern (such as a spiral or zigzag).  
   **Example**: The text is placed into a grid, and the characters are then read off in a specific route, like spiraling from the outside inward.

13. **Myszkowski Cipher**  
   The Myszkowski cipher is a transposition cipher where the text is written in a zigzag pattern and then read off in a specific order. It is similar to the Rail Fence cipher but with more complex patterns.  
   **Example**: The plaintext is arranged in a zigzag pattern, and then read in a pre-arranged order.

## Features:

- **Encryption and Decryption**: Each cipher includes both encryption and decryption functions, allowing you to encrypt and decrypt messages interactively.
- **Interactive Interface**: You can input any text and key, and choose the encryption or decryption mode to get the result.
- **Educational**: Great for cryptography enthusiasts and students to study and understand traditional cipher techniques.

## Conclusion:

This repository is perfect for anyone interested in learning and experimenting with classical cryptography techniques. Whether you're a beginner or just want to explore the history of encryption, these ciphers provide an excellent starting point to understand the basics of cryptography.
